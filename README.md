- Hello, I am UnoCheSiAnnoia. I am a beginner trying to finish some projects and I am putting them here on GitHub
- I am currently learning python, I know how to do a basic application but I am not really good at making UI. I also know some basics
of C++ and C# (but really, not much) and I know some basics of HTML+CSS (I studied it a bit to make a README.html for a project, I can probably make
some better styling but I never really got into it)

### Projects I am currently working on:
**PPD Mover**

This is an application that should help putting songs into the Project Diva emulator called PPD. Currently a basic version of the app is working and it has an
installer, but right now the project is paused. This project is public so it is possible to look at it. The code looks a bit bad right now but I am also slowly rewriting
it using OOP so it should be a bit better


**OSU! Songs Mover**

I am working on this right now, It is still not public on GitHub, right now it is a bit cluncky but it works fine, it has a console interface but I plan to add 
a custom UI for the application. 


All those things are made in Python and are made only by me 

This is probably not the best profile README but it is the truth (and also I am 16 what kind of offer should I get from this)
